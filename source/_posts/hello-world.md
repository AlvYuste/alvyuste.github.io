Hello to everyone reading! Welcome to the born of **this personal site**. Here you can find more [about who is writing](/about).

This channel is meant to be a **way of self-expression** and a **place to know me better**; yet I wish it also becomes a rich source of inspiration, useful tips and friendly discussions. I will try to share topics I consider interesting, surely most of them related with **technology** - as my job is. But I'll also write about my **everyday dramas** as web professional in this world as *heavy* as a `node_modules` folder.

I have participated in some other blogs before, some of them literary and others technical. But always in my mother language: Spanish. This is the first time that I dare to write it entirely in English. I aim to reach a broader audience and involve people from all over the world. For that reason I ask you to **be comprehensive**, but critic too. Don't hesitate to join the conversation to share your thoughts or send  any suggestions about the content, the format or the language.

I have had this project in mind for a long time, and finally it's ready to start. Let the show begin!
